### NNO.sh is a clone of is Hygieia

Hygieia is a single, configurable, easy-to-use dashboard to visualize near real-time status of the entire delivery pipeline for Capital One.  View [Hygieia in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoNTA78j0tc)

Capital One DevOps engineers developed Hygieia since no DevOps visualization tools were available in either the commercial market or the Open Source community

* There are some excellent commercial ALM tools that allow one to visualize traceability between stories, code, tests and builds however they do not cross over from build to deployment</li>

* There are some good commercial Operations tools that provide visibility into server and application run time health, metrics, analytics etc. however they do not provide visibility into the development and build activities</li>

* Open source tools/frameworks such as Grafana provide generic framework to build a dashboard however collecting data from the numerous DevOps tools is still the challenge.</li>
