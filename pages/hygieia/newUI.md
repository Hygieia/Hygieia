## What changes have we made to the UI? 

We have upgraded our old UI (using AngularJS) to a new UI, which uses Angular 8 and node 12.

This upgrade cleans up code, fixes existing bugs, and modernizes the user interface. With the same api, users will be able to take advantage of Hygieia's data from a different perspective with new charts, visualization tools, and UI features.
