## Overview  
Hygieia is a single, configurable, easy-to-use dashboard to visualize near real-time status of the entire delivery pipeline. The health of the continuous delivery pipeline, from code commit to production deployment, with all the necessary information around health and quality of the software, is essential for any DevOps Organization.

## Objectives
* Automate Development Environment Setup
* Continuous Performance Measurement and Visualization
* Unified DevOps Dashboard

## Features
- **Visual Delivery Pipeline** - Use the pipeline view to visualize the status of the entire delivery pipeline and the componentsâ€™ lifecycle progression.
- **Team Dashboard** - Monitor work items, code repo, builds, quality items (unit tests, security coverage), and deployments in a single dashboard.
- **Real-time Status** - Monitor quality, productivity, and work in process on a real-time basis within the dashboard.
- **Configurable View** - Set the dashboard to display the widgets that matter most to your project, which in turn amplifies and shortens the feedback loop.
- **Open Source** - Hygieia is open source and free for everyone to use. We encourage external users to contribute to the project.

## Audience  
The Installation Plan provides installation and configuration procedures for every part of the Hygieia system. This document describes the correct order for installing the component/tier instances and performing basic configuration.

This guide is intended for a technical audience to implement and support the application. The audience should have knowledge of Java, MongoDB, Javascript, Git, and RESTful APIs.
