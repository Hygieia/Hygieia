The README is in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/gh-pages/pages/hygieia/collectors/deploy/udeploy.md) branch. Please update it there.

# Topol, I don't want to add the complication of another pull request
# to add this data to the new README file location since it is only
# a few lines anyway.  For this reason, I have provided the data
# directly from the 2.0.4 file with context:


# UDeploy password (required)
udeploy.password=s3cr3t
===================== BEGIN NEW LINES ADDED ===========================

# Set timeout (in milliseconds) for socket connect/read and retry count
udeploy.socketConnectTimeoutMS=30000
udeploy.socketReadtimeoutMS=10000
udeploy.socketRetries=5
===================== END NEW LINES ADDED =============================
